### The circuit below is intended to capture information through luminosity sensors
### and distance convert into gamified information in dashboards and the platform Tago.Io with communication
### established via Node red & broker MQTT.

### The reading happens via sensors, arduino performs the Node-red reading, the Node red breaks down the analog information
### captured, and sends each information to its respective topic (Tago Io & broker MQTT).

### Information captured via brooker MQTT
